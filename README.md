# 👋 Hi there! I'm Samira 💚

🎓 I'm a Mechanical Engineering student passionate about blending **engineering**, **programming**, and **creativity** to build useful and meaningful things.

### 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 🛰️ Building a **CanSat satellite** with sensors (BME280, MPU6050, GPS, MQ-135, LoRa, ESP32-CAM) for Uzbekistan's first CanSat competition
- 🧠 Learning **machine learning**, AI for robotics (like pose/gesture detection for SpiderPi Pro), and **quantum mechanics**
- 📱 Developing a **flashcard app** (Python) for language learning with unique features like song-based vocabulary extraction
- 🦾 Exploring simple robotics and 3D modeling with **Blender**
- 💻 Improving my **Python**, **SQL**, and data visualization skills  
- 🔬 Preparing a research project for an exchange opportunity at **Khalifa University**  
- 🧩 Planning to launch educational **electronics project kits** in Uzbekistan (with 3D-printed parts, tutorials, and guides)

### 💡 Interests

- Robotics, AI, satellites, simulations  
- 3D modeling & product design  
- Learning languages (English, Chinese, Uzbek...)  
- Physics (Quantum, Mechanics, Circuits), Math  
- Reading 📚, music 🎶, drawing 🎨, cooking 🍳  
- Games like **Event Horizon Space RPG** and **Outer Wilds**

### 📚 Currently Learning

- Quantum mechanics & Fermi energy simulations  
- AI pose detection & gesture control  
- Python for simulations, data, and app dev  
- SQL for data work  
- Arduino + ESP32-based electronics

### 🔧 Tools & Languages

- Python, SQL, C/C++ (Arduino), HTML/CSS  
- Jupyter, VSCode, Git & GitHub  
- Blender, Fusion 360, Tinkercad  
- ESP32, LoRa, BME280, MPU6050, etc.

### 🌱 Goals

- Create educational content and tools for students in Central Asia  
- Study abroad and work on real-world projects  
- Build a strong portfolio of engineering + software projects  
- Improve speaking & writing in English — and maybe start a blog!
